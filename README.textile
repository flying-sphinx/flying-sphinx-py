h1. Flying Sphinx for Python

Nowhere near complete at the time of writing, but this will be a python client for "flying-sphinx.com":https://flying-sphinx.com (initially just as a Heroku add-on, but other platforms will be added too).

h2. Usage

From within Python code, here's what's supported thus far:

<pre><code>import flyingsphinx

flyingsphinx.sphinx().start()
flyingsphinx.sphinx().stop()</code></pre>

Credentials are sourced from the environment (FLYING_SPHINX_IDENTIFIER and FLYING_SPHINX_API_KEY), as expected within Heroku apps.

h2. Contributing

Patches are indeed welcome (especially given Python is not a language I'm familiar with at the moment). flying-sphinx.com API documentation will be provided at some point in the future, but generally keep in mind the following:

* The environment is managed via pip/virtualenv. To install requirements via pip, run the following command: @pip install -r requirements.txt --use-mirrors@.
* Write tests using nose and fudge. They can be run like so: @nosetests spec/**/*.py@
* Keep your commits in a separate branch.
* Don't mess around with the version number in your branch - this keeps merges easier for me to manage.
